# Google Consent Mode v2

## What is Google Consent Mode v2?

**Google Consent Mode v2** allows you to adjust how Google tags behave based on the user's consent choices. This helps ensure compliance with data protection regulations while still enabling important site functionality.

Consent Mode v2 particularly impacts:

- **Cookies**
- **Ad Personalization**
- **Analytics Tracking**

With **Consent Mode v2**, Google introduced two **new consent signals** required to comply with the **EU Digital Markets Act (DMA)**:

### Consent Signals:
- `ad_storage`
- `analytics_storage`
- `ad_user_data` (ðŸ†•)
- `ad_personalization` (ðŸ†•)
- `functionality_storage`
- `personalization_storage`
- `security_storage`

> The new signals `ad_user_data` and `ad_personalization` are essential under DMA for platforms like Google Ads and should be set according to user consent.

**Note:** The `functionality_storage`, `personalization_storage`, and `security_storage` signals can only be set to `granted` or `denied`.

    - All other fields are related to Google consent signal mapping. They are explained below.

**Note:** when the using GCM Basic Mode, the **GTM template** deployment option will not be available.

#### Consent Mapping:

Youâ€™ll now see dropdowns to map categories for the following Google consent signals:
- `ad_storage`
- `analytics_storage`
- `ad_user_data`
- `ad_personalization`

For each of these, select the relevant **consent category** from the dropdown list. You will see default mappings, but you can change them as per your requirements.

Once mappings are complete, you may continue filling out the other CMP configuration steps, or jump directly to the **Deployment"** tab for publishing your config.


>**Note:** If you are using **GCM Basic Mode**, you will see additional logic in your deployment script.

   below the comment `// Insert your GTM script here` you can add your GTM script. You can get the GTM script from your GTM account. It will look like this:
   
```js
(function (w, d, s, l, i) {
  w[l] = w[l] || [];
  w[l].push({ "gtm.start": new Date().getTime(), event: "gtm.js" });
  var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
    j = d.createElement(s),
    dl = l != "dataLayer" ? "&l=" + l : "";
  j.async = true;
  j.src = "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=" + i + dl;
  f.parentNode.insertBefore(j, f);
})(window, document, "script", "dataLayer", "{{Your_GTM_ID}}");
```
