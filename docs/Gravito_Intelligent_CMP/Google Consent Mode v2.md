# Google Consent Mode v2

## üîç What is Google Consent Mode v2?

**Google Consent Mode v2** allows you to adjust how Google tags (like GA4, Google Ads, Floodlight) behave based on the user's consent choices. This helps ensure compliance with data protection regulations while still enabling important site functionality.

Consent Mode v2 particularly impacts:

- üç™ **Cookies**
- üéØ **Ad Personalization**
- üìä **Analytics Tracking**

With **Consent Mode v2**, Google introduced two **new consent signals** required to comply with the **EU Digital Markets Act (DMA)**:

### ‚úÖ Consent Signals:
1. `ad_storage`
2. `analytics_storage`
3. `ad_user_data` (üÜï)
4. `ad_personalization` (üÜï)

> The new signals `ad_user_data` and `ad_personalization` are essential under DMA for platforms like Google Ads and should be set according to user consent.
