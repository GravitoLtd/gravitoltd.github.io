Gravito Intelligent CMP is a consent management solution that helps to collect consent for data collection, analytics, targeting, personalization and whatever your business needs to fulfil legal or regulatory terms.

ðŸ’¡ NoteHave you registered with Gravito yet? Please find here on how to getÂ [registered with Gravito](https://www.gravito.net/docs/getting-started/register/)

We have the Gravito Intelligent CMP configurator using which you can create the consent banner based on your needs

Note: If you are advertiser or publisher, you might benefit fromÂ [GravitoTCF 2.2 compliant CMP](https://www.gravito.net/docs/tcf-cmp/)Â but not every use case is the same so choice is yours.

To include light CMP in copy and paste following script in your website.

**Note**Â Replace gravitoCMPConifg with your config object.

`   window.gravitoCMPConfig = gravitoCMPConfig; // your config object  var gravitoSDKTag = document.createElement("script");  gravitoSDKTag.src = "https://cdn.gravito.net/sdkv2/latest/sdk.js";     gravitoSDKTag.onload = function () {       window.gravito.init("lightCMP");     };  document.body.appendChild(gravitoSDKTag);   `
