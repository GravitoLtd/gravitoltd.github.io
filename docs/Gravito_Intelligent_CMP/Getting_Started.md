Gravito Intelligent CMP is a consent management solution that helps to collect consent for data collection, analytics, targeting, personalization and whatever your business needs to fulfil legal or regulatory terms.

ðŸ’¡ Note: Have you registered with Gravito yet? Please find here on how to getÂ [registered with Gravito](../Getting_started/Register.md)

We have the Gravito Intelligent CMP configurator using which you can create the consent banner based on your needs

ðŸ’¡ Note: If you are advertiser or publisher, you might benefit fromÂ [GravitoTCF 2.2 compliant CMP](../Gravito_TCF_2.2_CMP/Getting_Started.md)Â but not every use case is the same so choice is yours.

To include light CMP in copy and paste following script in your website.

**Note**Â Replace gravitoCMPConifg with your config object.

```javascript

 window.gravitoCMPConfig = gravitoCMPConfig; // your config object  
 var gravitoSDKTag = document.createElement("script");  
 gravitoSDKTag.src = "https://cdn.gravito.net/sdkv2/latest/sdk.js";     
 gravitoSDKTag.onload = function () {       
    window.gravito.init("lightCMP");     
    };  
    document.body.appendChild(gravitoSDKTag);   
```
