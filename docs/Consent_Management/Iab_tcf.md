## Purpose of the TCF

The TCF aims to:

- **Standardize** the process of obtaining, managing, and communicating user consent for data processing in digital advertising.
- **Facilitate Compliance** with legal requirements by providing a common language and set of protocols for publishers, advertisers, and technology vendors.
- **Enhance Transparency** by informing users about how their data will be used and obtaining their explicit consent.

## Key Components

- **Global Vendor List (GVL):**
    - A registry of vendors participating in the TCF, detailing their data processing purposes and legal bases.

- **Consent Management Platform (CMP):**
    - Tools or services that help publishers collect, manage, and transmit user consent choices to vendors in a standardized manner.

- **Transparency & Consent String (TC String):**
    - A compressed, encoded data structure that records user consent choices and preferences, which is then shared with vendors to inform them of the user's decisions.

    - **Standardized Vendor Information:** Vendors must provide detailed information about data categories collected, retention periods, and any legitimate interests claimed.
