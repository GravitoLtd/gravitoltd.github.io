New Features

1.  Google Consent Mode V2 Integration in Light CMP:
    -   Gravito SDK now seamlessly integrates Google Consent Mode V2 functionalities within the Light CMP (Consent Management Platform). This update empowers developers to leverage Google's enhanced consent management features, allowing for more refined control over data tracking and advertising purposes.
    -   With this integration, developers can align their applications with evolving privacy regulations and user preferences by managing consent behavior based on user preferences regarding data collection and processing for advertising purposes.
2.  Support for Custom Cookie Expiry in TCF CMP 'Reject-All' Action:
    -   The Gravito SDK introduces support for customizing cookie expiration specifically for the 'Reject-All' action within the TCF CMP (Transparency and Consent Framework Consent Management Platform).
    -   Developers can now set distinct cookie expiry duration for cookies generated when users opt to 'Reject All' within the CMP UI. This feature empowers publishers to manage cookie lifespans, facilitating re-prompting of CMP UI after a lower expiry period for users who have initially rejected all consent. This is available to be set in the TCF CMP configurator on Gravito portal
