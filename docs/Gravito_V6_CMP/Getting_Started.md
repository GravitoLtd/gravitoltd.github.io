window.gravito.config=gravitoConfig

    // load gravito SDK
  var gravitoSDKTag = document.createElement("script");
      gravitoSDKTag.src = "https://cdn.gravito.net/sdk/v6/latest/sdk.js";
      gravitoSDKTag.onload = function () {
        window.gravito.init();
      };
      document.head.appendChild(gravitoSDKTag);;

### Resurfacing 

To open the CMP again, we have a window-scoped function which can be used:

```window.gravito.cmp.openPreferences() â€” this will open the second layer (Details tab).```

To open the first layer (Declaration tab):

```window.gravito.cmp.openPreferences(0) â€” this will open the first layer (Declaration).```
