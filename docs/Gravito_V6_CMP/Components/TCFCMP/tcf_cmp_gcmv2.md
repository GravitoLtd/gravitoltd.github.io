# Google Consent Mode v2

## What is Google Consent Mode v2?

**Google Consent Mode v2** allows you to adjust how Google tags behave based on the user's consent choices. This helps ensure compliance with data protection regulations while still enabling important site functionality.

Consent Mode v2 particularly impacts:

- **Cookies**
- **Ad Personalization**
- **Analytics Tracking**

With **Consent Mode v2**, Google introduced two **new consent signals** required to comply with the **EU Digital Markets Act (DMA)**:

### Consent Signals:
- `ad_storage`
- `analytics_storage`
- `ad_user_data` (ðŸ†•)
- `ad_personalization` (ðŸ†•)

> The new signals `ad_user_data` and `ad_personalization` are essential under DMA for platforms like Google Ads and should be set according to user consent.

2. Click on the **CMP** tab.
3. Select the **Gravito CMP (New) Configurator** from the option.
4. On the CMP Config listing page, click the **New Configuration** button to create a new CMP Config.
5. Give config an appropriate name and choose **TCF CMP** as **Framework**. After that, click **Get Started** to proceed.

6. Now navigate to **TCF CMP** tab and **TCF Settings** sub-tab for GCMv2 related setup.
7. You can enable GCM by checking the checkbox labeled **Google's GCM-V2**.
8. After enabling GCM, some additional fields will appear for configuration.

    - **Use GCM Advance Mode** is enabled by default. You can uncheck this if you want to use the **Basic Mode**.
    - All other fields are related to Google consent signal mapping. They are explained below.

**Note:** when the using GCM Basic Mode, the **GTM template** deployment option will not be available.

#### Google's Consent Signal Mapping:

Youâ€™ll now see default mapping for the following Google consent signals::

- `ad_storage`
- `analytics_storage`
- `ad_user_data`
- `ad_personalization`

These signals are pre-mapped to the TCF purposes based on Google's requirements and should not be changed.

you may continue filling out the other CMP configuration steps, or jump directly to the **Deployment"** tab for publishing your config.


>**Note:** If you are using **GCM Basic Mode**, you will see additional logic in your deployment script.

   below the comment `// Insert your GTM script here` you can add your GTM script. You can get the GTM script from your GTM account. It will look like this:
   
```js
(function (w, d, s, l, i) {
  w[l] = w[l] || [];
  w[l].push({ "gtm.start": new Date().getTime(), event: "gtm.js" });
  var f = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
    j = d.createElement(s),
    dl = l != "dataLayer" ? "&l=" + l : "";
  j.async = true;
  j.src = "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=" + i + dl;
  f.parentNode.insertBefore(j, f);
})(window, document, "script", "dataLayer", "{{Your_GTM_ID}}");
```

### Custom Events in dataLayer

Gravito SDK as well as the GTM template will automatically push custom events to the `dataLayer` based on user consent choices. These events can be used to trigger specific tags in Google Tag Manager.

Below are the primary GTM events pushed by Gravito for consent updates:

- **gravitoGCMConsents**

  This event is triggered when there is an update in the Gravito Consent Management (GCM) consents. It pushes the current consent states as an object, which can be used for conditional tag firing in GTM.

  ```javascript
  dataLayer.push({
    event: "gravitoGCMConsents",
    consents: consents,  // Object containing the user's consent states
  });.
  ```

- **gravitoTCFConsents**

  This event is triggered when there is an update in the Gravito Consent Management (GCM) consents. It pushes the current consent states as an object, which can be used for conditional tag firing in GTM.

```javascript
 window.dataLayer.push({
  event: "gravitoTCFConsents",
  consentObj: currentState,  // Object representing the current TCF consent state
});
  ```
