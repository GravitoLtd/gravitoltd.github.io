Getting Started
Gravito API is a powerful tool when it comes to collecting consent statistics while allowing you to connect multiple ids that you use in your setup and give it more persistence. One of the key features of the Gravito API, the Gravito ID Connector is enabled using the server side microprofile which is created. We will discuss this in more detail in the coming section. Here are the sections that we will have in this section.
