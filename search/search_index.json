First party API was initially developed as simple microservice to help with setting first party cookie to hold CMP settings and consents. As more advanced requirements started to surface we thought that calling the service \u201cmicroprofile\u201d would be reasonable. Micro means simple, right? Wish it was. However, the general idea is pretty simple. We store various types of attributes to a cookie that is set from server-side by API served from sub-domain associated with your domain. Two reasons why: 1) server-side cookie lasts longer than cookies set by javascript running on client2) API operating on your domain avoids the blocking of third party cookies (now and the future) How does it work? First learn about setting up First Party API , after registering your domain(s) you are ready to roll: (Example provided based on Version 3 ) (function () { var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); var params = { \"e\": { \"matchOnId\": \"dem05\", \"id1\": \"xyz\", \"counterPageView\":\"2\" }, \"k\": [{ \"i\":\"1\", \"k\":\"GAID\", \"v\": \"2700108e-b965-4d98-b214-274b0701725a\" }, { \"i\":\"2\", \"k\":\"OMID\", \"v\": \"cb115185-2a25-4587-8ff5-e3fe7cc7a25b\" } ], \"c\": [ { \"i\":\"t\", \"c\":\"consent1\", \"s\": false }, { \"i\":\"m\", \"c\":\"consent2\", \"s\": false } ] }; xhr.open(\"POST\", 'https://gto.<yourdomain>/api/v3/firstparty', true); xhr.withCredentials = true; xhr.onreadystatechange = function(response) { if(xhr.readyState == XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status == 200) { console.log(\"POST response : \" + response.target.response); } } xhr.send(JSON.stringify(params)); })(); Looks heavy? Let\u2019s open the structure of \u201cparams\u201d a bit. It consists of three main branches: \u201ce\u201d stands for events , that is any key/value pairs that you might need to store into microprofile. Only restricted key name is \u201c matchOnId \u201d which we use to connect microprofiles to each other when there is e.g. hash of user email available, ie. user has logged in and microprofile can be associated to a person. Further on matchOnId has two reserved values: 1) \u201cdisconnect\u201d allows you to disassociate microprofile from login but keep the history and 2) \u201creset\u201d performs disconnect and wipes the microprofile to default stage. \u201ck\u201d stands for keyring , allowing any key/value pairs stored inside keyring. Functionality is somewhat the same as with events but adding/modifying a key is recorded with timestamp, that allows to link the consents collected to these keys (and whether the keys can be used for whatever purpose they were recorded). Keyring (\u201ck\u201d) has fixed structure: \"i\":\"keyId\", -> string\"k\":\"keyName\", -> string\"v\": \"keyValue\" -> string When sending requests to API you will notice that keyring items will have timestamp \u201ct\u201d set by the API, containing timestamp in epochtime. \u201cc\u201d stands for consents , that is to collect the consents received from CMP. Again the behavior follows the key/value pairs approach but with fixed structure: \"i\":\"consentId\", -> string\"c\":\"consentName\", -> string\"s\": status as true or false -> bool Same as with keyring, the timestamp of adding/modifying particular consentId is recorded and returned in API responses. This allows to monitor that when consents are changed and how those turning points connect to collected IDs in keyring (allowing or preventing further activities within integrated systems).","title":"Microprofile"},{"location":"Gravito_API/Microprofile/#microprofile","text":"Microprofile which relies on Gravito Firstparty API v3 is in Beta testing Gravito Microprofile is sort of a synonym to first party API.

Version 2.0.5 First layer supports now \u201cReject all\u201d button, enable it by defining third button label for first layer: actions: [\"Asetukset\",\"Hyv\u00e4ksy kaikki\",\"Est\u00e4 kaikki\"] Version 2.0.4 Max-width of the screen is changed to 100px with small screens. Version 2.0.3 CMP cookie content encoded (allows special characters in names of consent groups). Version 2.0.2 Minor bug and CSS fixes. Version 2.0.1 Support for Gravito SDK (enables e.g. integration with Gravito CDP), naming changes, minor enhancements. Version 1.0.4 Minor bug fixes, cookie setting to support subdomains added. Add following to configuration of CMP: useTopDomain:true Version 1.0.3 CSS fixes, support for RTL. Version 1.0.2 CSS fixes, minor bug fixes Version 1.0.1 Added support for Google Consent Mode (beta), see separate page for more details. Version 1.0.0 Fully responsive, mobile optimized UI Presentation, CMP core logic and configuration are separated to allow maximum customization flexibility and deployment strategies Event-driven, user activity (consents, rejections etc.) emits events that can trigger ad/martech tags, data to analytics etc. Localization through configuration file Standard, tested deployment with tag management systems like Google Tag Manager, Tealium iQ and Ensighten","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"Gravito_Intelligent_CMP/Setup_and_Design/","text":"Gravito Intelligent CMP Setup can be done using Gravito CMP Configurator on Gravito\u2019s Admin Portal.

It provides a way to use your own CSS (and design system) to style the elements on CMP modals. Using your own elements for CMP instead of default modals To render the first-layer and second-layer of Gravito Intelligent CMP into your own container elements you need to add following fields inside core section of your CMP config gravitoCMPconfig={ core:{ // ... other properties ... firstLayerId: \"cmpfirstlayer\", // elementID for CMP 1st layer secondLayerId: \"cmpsecondlayer\", // elementID for CMP 2nd layer thirdLayerId: \"cmpthirdlayer\", // elementID for CMP 3rd layer } } NOTE: If CMP do not find these elements in DOM i.e document.getElementById(id)===undefined, then CMP will use it's own container instead and append those inside the body of html. Keep these fields undefined if you want to use CMP default modals. Using your own CSS to style the elements With this headless version you can use customize the UI of CMP by providing your own CSS for the given class of CMP element. To configure CMP to use custom CSS file you change \"useCustomCss:true\" inside style section of your config. gravitoCMPconfig={ style:{ ///other properties useCustomCss: true,// false to use gravito's Default CSS } } NOTE: You should ensure that your custom css file is loaded in DOM before loading CMP. Make sure your CSS file has all classes specified in CMP CSS file. You can see the sample CSS file here . Examples Customizing CMP UI using \"useCustomCss\" option and Gravito's CSS file For Example let's assume that you need to change the color of \"Accept All\" button on first layer of CMP. By default it is orange. Before: Step 1 : Copy the custom CSS file provided by gravito into your css file, you can find the file here . Step 2 : find the CSS class name \".gravitoLightCMP-layer1-actions-accept-all\". It will look like this .gravitoLightCMP-layer1-actions-accept-all { outline: none; margin: 10px; font-size: 18px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale; color: #fff; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; border-radius: 22px; border: none; cursor: pointer; height: 40px; width: auto; padding: 0px 12px; margin: 0px 5px; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); font-family: \"gravitoFont\"; background-color: #ffa500; font-size: 10pt; } Step 3: Change the background color property value to the color you want to use,here I will make it \"purple\". Now the class should look like this .gravitoLightCMP-layer1-actions-accept-all { outline: none; margin: 10px; font-size: 18px; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale; color: #fff; box-sizing: border-box; display: block; border-radius: 22px; border: none; cursor: pointer; height: 40px; width: auto; padding: 0px 12px; margin: 0px 5px; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); font-family: \"gravitoFont\"; background-color: purple; font-size: 10pt; } Step 4 : Now Add this file to your website.

To enable this you will have to add resurfaceOnMissingVersion: true to the core section of your config. Test your implementation of Light CMP Version 4 thoroughly to ensure that all features are working as expected and that there are no issues with the updated CSS structure or GCM/backend integration. Once you have confirmed that everything is working as expected, you can proceed with deploying Light CMP Version 4 on your production website. Note Please note that this is a general guide and your specific implementation may require additional steps. It is always recommended to test your implementation thoroughly before deploying it to production. If you have any questions or issues during the migration process, please reach out to Gravito support for assistance.","title":"Version 4 (Latest)"},{"location":"Gravito_Intelligent_CMP/advanced/Latest_Config/#version-4-latest","text":"","title":"Version 4 (Latest)"},{"location":"Gravito_Intelligent_CMP/advanced/Latest_Config/#how-it-works","text":"","title":"How it works?"},{"location":"Gravito_Intelligent_CMP/advanced/Latest_Config/#configuration","text":"Light CMP can be configure and customize as per your need with the help of configuration object.You can generate this configuration object using our Admin Portal or you can create your own from scratch.

To enable this you will have to add resurfaceOnMissingVersion: true to the core section of your config. Test your implementation of Light CMP Version 4 thoroughly to ensure that all features are working as expected and that there are no issues with the updated CSS structure or GCM/backend integration. Once you have confirmed that everything is working as expected, you can proceed with deploying Light CMP Version 4 on your production website. Note Please note that this is a general guide and your specific implementation may require additional steps. It is always recommended to test your implementation thoroughly before deploying it to production. If you have any questions or issues during the migration process, please reach out to Gravito support for assistance.","title":"Migrating to lightCMP Version 4"},{"location":"Gravito_Intelligent_CMP/advanced/Light_Cmp_Config_Options/","text":"Config example You can check out a Gravito Intelligent CMP configuration example here Following variables are good within \"gravitoCMPConfig\" variable.
